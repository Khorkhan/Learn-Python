🐍 Python Learning Journey & Mini Projects
This is my Python project repository. This is a complete log of my learning journey with learnpython.org. This project contains my learning notes, code examples, and a complete capstone project that covers all the basic concepts learned and mastered

📚 Topics Covered
I have completed the "Learn the Basics" course, which covers the following topics:
1. Hello, World! - Syntax and Printing.
2. Variables and Types - Integers, Floats, and Strings.
3. Lists & Dictionaries - Data Structures and Collection Management.
4. Basic Operators - Arithmetic and Logical Operations.
5. String Formatting & Operations - String Management and Beautification.
6. Conditions & Loops - Control Structures and If-Else, For, and While.
7. Functions - Modular and Reusable Code.
8. Classes and Objects - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
9. Modules and Packages - Using Multiple Code Files.

🚀 Featured Project: Mini Inventory Management System
To further reinforce my learning, I have developed a Mini Inventory Management System. This is a command-line system that demonstrates how different concepts can be used in a real-world application.
Key Features:
OOP Concept - Using the Product class.
Data Storage - Using Lists and Dictionaries.
Dynamic Calculations - Using basic operators.
Interactive CLI - Using Loops and Conditional Statements.
