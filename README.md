🐍 Python Learning Journey & Mini Projects
This is my Python project repository. This is a complete log of my learning journey with learnpython.org. This project contains my learning notes, code examples, and a complete capstone project that covers all the basic concepts learned and mastered.
📚 Topics Covered
I have completed the "Learn the Basics" course, which covers the following topics:
Hello, World! - Syntax and Printing.
Variables and Types - Integers, Floats, and Strings.
Lists & Dictionaries - Data Structures and Collection Management.
Basic Operators - Arithmetic and Logical Operations.
String Formatting & Operations - String Management and Beautification.
Conditions & Loops - Control Structures and If-Else, For, and While.
Functions - Modular and Reusable Code.
Classes and Objects - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
Modules and Packages - Using Multiple Code Files.
🚀 Featured Project: Mini Inventory Management System
To further reinforce my learning, I have developed a Mini Inventory Management System. This is a command-line system that demonstrates how different concepts can be used in a real-world application.
Key Features:
OOP Concept - Using the Product class.
Data Storage - Using Lists and Dictionaries.
Dynamic Calculations - Using basic operators.
Interactive CLI - Using Loops and Conditional Statements.
