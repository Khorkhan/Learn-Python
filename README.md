🐍 Python Learning Journey & Mini Projects
Welcome to my Python repository! This project serves as a comprehensive log of my progress while learning Python through learnpython.org. It contains my practice notes, code snippets, and a functional capstone project that integrates all the fundamental concepts I've mastered.

📚 Topics Covered
I have completed the "Learn the Basics" track, which includes:

Hello, World! - Basic syntax and printing.

Variables and Types - Integers, floats, and strings.

Lists & Dictionaries - Data structures and collection management.

Basic Operators - Arithmetic and logical operations.

String Formatting & Operations - Manipulating and beautifying text output.

Conditions & Loops - Control flow with if/else, for, and while.

Functions - Writing reusable and modular code.

Classes and Objects - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Modules and Packages - Organizing code into multiple files.

🚀 Featured Project: Mini Inventory Management System
To put my knowledge into practice, I developed a Mini Inventory Management System. This project is a command-line tool that demonstrates how different Python concepts work together in a real-world scenario.

Key Features:
OOP Implementation: Uses a Product class to store and manage item data.

Data Management: Utilizes Lists and Dictionaries to track stock levels.

Dynamic Calculations: Automatically calculates total inventory value using basic operators.

Interactive CLI: A user-friendly menu driven by loops and conditional logic.
